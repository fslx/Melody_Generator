# Melody_Generator
Melody generator idea I had, I decided to write it using C++ as at some point I envision it to have an ability to read off of actual Synth hardware-keys and then generate melodies and play them aloud via either a DAW or make a direct call the the hardware-synth and play the melody using speakers.
